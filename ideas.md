  **Design Movement**: Industrial Brutalism meets Modern Utility
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Functionality**: The interface should feel like a well-organized workshop—tools are visible, accessible, and sturdy.
  2. **High Contrast & Clarity**: Essential for a mechanic who might be checking this on a phone with greasy hands or in bright sunlight.
  3. **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons and interactions should feel "heavy" and satisfying, like flipping a switch or turning a wrench.
  4. **No-Nonsense Navigation**: Linear, straightforward paths with no hidden menus.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Safety Orange (#FF6B00)**: Used for primary actions and "call to attention" moments, inspired by safety gear and warning lights.
  - **Oil Black (#1A1A1A)**: The primary background, reducing eye strain and providing a sleek, professional look.
  - **Steel Grey (#4A5568)**: For secondary elements and containers, mimicking the look of tools and machinery.
  - **Signal Green (#00E676)**: Strictly for success states and correct answers, cutting through the dark theme.
  - *Reasoning*: This palette resonates with the automotive environment—it feels familiar, professional, and masculine without being aggressive.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Dashboard-Centric**: A main "control panel" view for progress tracking.
  - **Card-Based Modules**: Each grammar topic is a "job card" or "work order" that needs to be completed.
  - **Split-Screen Dialogues**: Dialogues presented like a script or a chat interface, clearly separating speakers.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **"Job Card" Headers**: Topic titles styled like mechanic work orders with monospaced fonts for metadata (Topic #, Date, Status).
  - **Progress Gauges**: Circular or linear gauges (like a speedometer or fuel gauge) to show topic completion.
  - **Tool Iconography**: Custom icons representing grammar concepts using automotive metaphors (e.g., a wrench for "fixing" sentences, a diagnostic computer for quizzes).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **"Punch In/Punch Out"**: Starting a lesson feels like clocking in; finishing feels like signing off a job.
  - **Direct Manipulation**: Drag-and-drop for sentence building, large tap targets for multiple choice.

  **Animation**:
  - **Mechanical Transitions**: Slides and drawers move with a precise, eased "snap" rather than a floaty drift.
  - **Loading States**: A revving tachometer or a gear spinning.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Chakra Petch* or *Rajdhani* (squared, technical sans-serif) for that "digital dashboard" look.
  - **Body**: *Roboto* or *Inter* (clean, legible sans-serif) for maximum readability in explanations and dialogues.
  - **Code/Examples**: *JetBrains Mono* for specific grammar structures to highlight them as "technical specs."

  **Design Movement**: Warm Mediterranean Modernism
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Welcoming & Personal**: The platform should feel like a friendly mentor, not a cold machine.
  2. **Cultural Resonance**: Subtly incorporating Tunisian visual cues (patterns, colors) without being cliché.
  3. **Soft & Approachable**: Rounded corners, gentle shadows, and a light, airy feel to reduce anxiety about learning.
  4. **Story-Driven**: The interface frames the learning journey as a narrative of Oussama's career growth.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Tunisian Blue (#1E88E5)**: The primary brand color, evoking the sea and sky, used for headers and primary buttons.
  - **Sand/Beige (#F5F5DC)**: A warm, neutral background that is easier on the eyes than stark white.
  - **Terracotta (#E64A19)**: For accents and "needs attention" states, inspired by traditional pottery and rooftops.
  - **Olive Green (#558B2F)**: For success states and progress, representing growth and nature.
  - *Reasoning*: This palette feels "home" to a Tunisian user while maintaining a fresh, modern educational vibe. It's inviting and optimistic.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Single-Column Focus**: Content is presented in a focused, central stream to minimize distraction.
  - **Floating Action Buttons**: Key actions are always within reach but unobtrusive.
  - **Conversational UI**: Explanations and exercises are presented as a dialogue between the system and the user.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Mosaic Patterns**: Subtle, modern interpretations of Tunisian tile patterns (Zellige) used as section dividers or background textures.
  - **Avatar Guides**: Friendly illustrations of characters (Oussama, Karim, Customers) that appear throughout the lessons.
  - **Paper/Card Texture**: Content containers have a slight texture to feel like a notebook or manual.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **"Guide by the Hand"**: Step-by-step reveals of information rather than overwhelming walls of text.
  - **Encouraging Feedback**: Micro-interactions that celebrate small wins (confetti, checkmarks, positive sounds).

  **Animation**:
  - **Fluid & Organic**: Soft fades and gentle slides.
  - **Pulse Effects**: Important elements gently pulse to guide attention.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Cairo* (a font that supports Arabic and Latin script beautifully, bridging the two worlds) or *Fredoka One* for a friendly touch.
  - **Body**: *Nunito* or *Quicksand* (rounded sans-serifs) to reinforce the approachable, friendly tone.

  **Design Movement**: Neo-Retro Garage Manual
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Nostalgic Authority**: Evoking the feel of classic Haynes car repair manuals—authoritative, detailed, and diagrammatic.
  2. **Schematic Clarity**: Information is presented like a technical diagram—exploded views of sentences, clear labels.
  3. **Paper & Ink**: A high-contrast, print-inspired aesthetic adapted for the screen.
  4. **Structured Learning**: Very organized, grid-based, and methodical.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Blueprint Blue (#003366)**: Deep, rich blue for backgrounds or headers, reminiscent of technical blueprints.
  - **Paper White (#FAFAFA)**: The main canvas.
  - **Manual Yellow (#FFD700)**: Highlighting key information, like a highlighter pen on a manual page.
  - **Ink Black (#000000)**: For text and strong borders.
  - *Reasoning*: This style treats English grammar as a mechanical system to be understood, which appeals to a mechanic's mindset. It frames language learning as "repairing" or "assembling" sentences.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Grid System**: Visible grids and lines separating content areas.
  - **Sidebar Navigation**: A persistent index (like a manual's table of contents) always visible.
  - **Exploded Views**: Grammar rules broken down visually into component parts (Subject + Verb + Object).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Technical Illustrations**: Line-art style illustrations of car parts and tools.
  - **"Exploded" Sentence Diagrams**: Visualizing sentence structure like a mechanical assembly.
  - **Typewriter/Monospace Accents**: For examples and "raw data."

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **"Assembly"**: Dragging words to slots to build sentences.
  - **"Diagnostics"**: Quizzes framed as diagnostic tests with checkboxes.

  **Animation**:
  - **Drawing/Sketching**: Lines drawing themselves, text appearing as if typed.
  - **Page Turns**: Subtle transitions that mimic flipping a page.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Oswald* or *Bebas Neue* (condensed, strong sans-serif) for section headers.
  - **Body**: *Lora* or *Merriweather* (sturdy serifs) for high readability, mimicking print manuals.
  - **Accents**: *Courier Prime* for code/grammar structures.
